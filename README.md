# A_Tribute
This HTML and CSS code is designed to create a tribute webpage dedicated to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, a renowned Indian scientist and former President of India. 

HTML Code Description:
  HTML Structure:
      The HTML page uses a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration for HTML5 and is divided into head and body sections.
      The head section includes metadata such as character set (UTF-8), viewport settings for responsive design, and a link to an external CSS file (Tribute.css).
  Body Content:
      A container div wraps all the page content and serves as the main layout wrapper with a border and padding.
      The content div centers the content and sets a maximum width for the page.
  Top Section (top_section):
      This section contains two main parts: an image and a title with the name and lifespan of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.
      The image is sourced from Wikipedia, and the heading tags (h1 and h3) display the name "A.P.J. Abdul Kalam" and the years "1931-2015".
  About Section (about):
      This section includes a large heading (h2) titled "Missile Man of India."
      A detailed paragraph below provides biographical information about A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's life, career, and contributions to India's space and missile programs.
  Biography Section (biography):
      This section contains a list of biographies about Abdul Kalam. It uses an unordered list (<ul>, though not explicitly mentioned here) to list various books and documentaries about his life and work.
  Footer:
      The footer contains a link to Wikipedia where the user can read more about A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.
CSS Code Description:
  Global Styling:
      The * selector applies a reset, removing all default margin and padding from elements and setting box-sizing: border-box to ensure proper box-model behavior.
  Container Styling (.container):
      The main container has a light background color (#d3d6f0), full vertical height (min-height: 100vh), a 10px black border, and 10px padding.
  Content Styling (.content):
      The content is centered using margin: 0 auto, with a maximum width of 900px to restrict its size on larger screens.
  Image Styling (.image img):
      The image is styled to be circular with border-radius: 45%, and has a fixed width (250px) and height (300px).
  Top Section Layout (.top_section):
      This section is laid out using flexbox, ensuring that the image and headings align properly. justify-content: space-between separates the image and text, and align-items: flex-end ensures they align towards the bottom of the section.
  About Section Styling (.about):
      The heading (h2) has a large font size (60px), and the paragraph text is justified, with a serif font, increased line height (25px), and letter-spacing to improve readability.
  Biography Section Styling (.biography):
      This section adds spacing (margin-top: 50px), and the list items are styled with a serif font and left margin to separate them visually from the rest of the text.
  Footer Styling (footer):
      The footer is aligned to the right (text-align: end) and includes a link to the Wikipedia page.    


Overall, this code creates a clean, well-structured tribute page with responsive design elements and appropriate typography to honor A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.
